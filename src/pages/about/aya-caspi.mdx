She has led Convergent Facilitation processes in a variety of settings including at a high school to create a new tardiness policy, with a family of four siblings deciding how to distribute a parentâ€™s estate, at a theater in deciding how to navigate rehearsals for a play and within my own family. She has taught Convergent Facilitation with the NVC Academy and in China (via Zoom). She loves Convergent Facilitation because it transforms both coercion and consensus and allows for effectivity and inclusion to happen simultaneously.

She is a Certified Trainer with the Center for Nonviolent Communication based in Grass Valley, CA. She has dedicated herself to applying radical, uncompromising nonviolence in every small detail of life, starting with the ongoing laboratory of my family, including my three children. I continually grapple with the joys and challenges of being raised in Israel and find deep meaning and hope in applying NVC to the context of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and its effect on the regional community.

She has worked in settings as varied as BayNVC Leadership program, schools [1], family and business coaching and mediation, couple counseling, and promoting Israeli-Palestinian dialogue.

She has been teaching Nonviolent Communication over the past 13 years via online classes, workshops and retreats in the US and around the world.  Find out more at www.cnvc.org/profile/3192
