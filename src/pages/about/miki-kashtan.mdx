Miki developed Convergent Facilitation through trial and error in hundreds of situations she facilitated. She then wrote the book The Highest Common Denominator: Using Convergent Facilitation To Reach Breakthrough Collaborative Decisions, which includes an entire chapter based on the case study of the most extensive application of Convergent Facilitation to date. Miki taught Convergent Facilitation for several years, and is now happy as a clam that there are enough people who can use Convergent Facilitation as well as teach it so that she can focus her energy elsewhere. The only applications she herself am willing to take are those bringing together multi-stakeholder groups with the intention to address one of the worldâ€™s major crises: energy and climate, health, food sovereignty, global disparities and violence, and impending collapse. 

Miki can facilitate in English, Spanish and Hebrew.
