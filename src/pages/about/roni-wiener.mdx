Roni advocates for personal empowerment and social change through coaching, teaching, consulting, and activism. They enjoy sharing my passion and insights in diverse settings and scales, from small groups to large organizations. My life journey includes two decades of consulting focused on transforming collaboration practices, extensive work in technology projects and design, and an interdisciplinary degree in Psychology, Sociology, and Gender Studies. They offer fun and interactive workshops on topics ranging from process improvement and project planning to nonviolence, relationships, and sexual health. At other times, they may be found on the dance floor, at the beach, cuddling, playing games, engaging in deep conversations, writing an unpublished blog, and plotting global liberation.
