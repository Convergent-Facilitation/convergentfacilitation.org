# Support Our Work

All Convergent Facilitation resources and events are offered as a gift, so that everyone can make use of them and participate regardless of how much access to resources they have. We invite you to contribute an amount thatâ€™s the most you can give without overstretching or feeling resentful. What you contribute supports the ongoing stewarding of the Convergent Facilitation infrastructure, resources and projects, attends to the sustainability of the coaches, and brings more Convergent Facilitation projects into the world.

### Give via Paypal

The most straight forward way to donate is currently via Paypal. Choose a one-time or recurring donation. We are working on making more methods available.
