## Case Study: Transforming polarized politics in the Minnesota state legislature

**When statehouse adversaries began working together with a facilitator from the Nonviolent Global
Liberation Community, a gridlocked political debate gave way to a remarkable shared win.**

The Minnesota Child Custody Dialogue Group transcended deeply entrenched positions and a
history of personal mistrust to resolve an issue that had seemed intractable for years. The one
new factor was Convergent Facilitation, a three-step framework for group decision-making. First
the dialogue group translated their differing views into deeper principles that all agreed on.
Then those principles inspired new proposals. Finally, they used their newfound mutual
understanding to craft a collaborative solution.

> “*People became problemsolvers rather than position-staters.*” ~ Bruce Peterson, former family court judge

> “*I went in thinking it was going to be a disaster and came out with hope.*” ~ Brian Ulrich, parent advocate
