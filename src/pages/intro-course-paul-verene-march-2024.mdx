## What is Convergent Facilitation? & Why learn it?

We live in a time of multiple devastating crises and challenges - could we come together to find a way to turn things around? 

Convergent Facilitation (CF) is a process for getting to a genuine agreement about how to move forward with any shared practical problem or disagreement. It’s particularly transformative with highly polarised issues, helping people find practical ways forward that address what really matters to everyone involved, in an efficient way. CF has helped people in a range of contexts around the world reach creative solutions to complex challenges, where no-one loses or is left behind. The principles of CF can enhance any kind of group facilitation and collaboration.

If you work with groups, organisations, communities or diverse stakeholders trying to make the world a better place, CF could make a big difference to your ability to:

- Find what is important to everyone in group in a way that brings a people together, even when that might seem impossible
- Support a group to come up with creative ways of fulfilling all the needs people have for a solution, in a meaningful way
- Check carefully for any concerns and actively engage with disagreement about any proposals or ideas, and respond by improving solutions until everyone can genuinely say yes to them
- Engage with imbalances of power and group dynamics, facilitating real collaboration
- Help groups move forwards in clear, effective ways


## Where might you apply CF? & Who is this course for?

We are keen to offer this training to people who have a clear context to put their learning into practice, and in particular to people who are actively engaged in:

- Participatory/Deliberative Democracy (e.g. People’s Assemblies, Citizen’s Assemblies, etc.) 
- Community Organising
- Progressive Social Movements - trying to build a world that’s sustainable and works for all
- Mediation, Conflict Resolution, Collaborative Facilitation, etc.


## What will the course involve?

This course will run over 4 weeks in March 2024, online. It will involve an exploration of the core principles and practices of Convergent Facilitation through input and demonstrations from Paul and Verene, space to ask questions, and a lot of practice and supportive coaching. 

There will also be the possibility of a second session each week focused on practice. We hope most people who take part in the course will engage in an ongoing practice group to really integrate and develop their learning.


The course will be run by Paul Kahawatte and Verene Nicolas, who are both leading practitioners of  Convergent Facilitation.
