## What is Convergent Facilitation


Convergent Facilitation is a process for getting to a genuine agreement about how to move forward with any shared problem or disagreement. It’s focused on getting down to what’s really important to everyone involved, and building that into practical solutions that everyone can wholeheartedly support. It offers ways to do this smoothly and swiftly. It can be used in lots of situations, and it’s been particularly transformative in situations where there is strong disagreement between people, or when a problem is particularly complex. It’s about finding a way forward where no-one loses or is left behind, and people get what they need from the solution they create together. 

CF has helped people find a way through major disagreements to a  in a range of different situations around the world to  , and it offers a collaborative way to address many of the crises and polarised issues we are facing, together.

**The process:**
1. Gets clear on what is important to everyone involved - what do people need from an outcome or solution
2. Comes up with creative ways of fulfilling all the needs people have for a solution
3. Checks carefully for any concerns about the proposal(s) that have been created (or any upgrades to them), and responds to them by improving the solution until everyone can genuinely say yes to it
4. Engages with imbalances of power and group dynamics, facilitating real and meaningful collaboration

## What will the course involve?
This course will run over 4 weeks in March 2024, online. It will involve an exploration of the core principles and practices of C.F. through input from Paul and Verene, Q&A, and a lot of practice and supportive coaching.
