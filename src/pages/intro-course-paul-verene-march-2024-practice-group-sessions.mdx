# *Practice Group Sessions* for Radical Collaboration â€” An Introduction to Convergent Facilitation 

We are delighted to have a list of practice sessions spanning several days and timezones as an integral part of the course. Thank you to all the facilitators who have volunteered to hold the sessions. 

We want to stress again how important practice is to integrate the method and genuinely start making a difference as to how decisions are made in the world. We therefore have a strong request that everyone signs up to one of those sessions or self-organises by creating a group with other participants (see the option below).  

## How to register for a practice group session?

If you haven't done already, please register for the course. As soon as your participation is confirmed, **we will send you a link to a form via email** (search your inbox for "Practice Group Registration") where you can pick a practice group. You've already registered but didn't receive a link yet? Please send us an email to [mar24-intro-course@convergentfacilitation.org](mailto:mar24-intro-course@convergentfacilitation.org).

Please look at the list of sessions below and check which one fits your availability. Times and dates should automatically be displayed in your local time zone. If not, please take a look at this spreadsheet for the times in UTC. To register for a particular session, please note the name of the support person and coloured dot associated with it and fill in the registration form. 

ðŸ˜•ðŸ•œ **None of the offered time slots below is working for you? It will be possible to self-organise with other participants to set up your own group. You'll see this option in the form.**
