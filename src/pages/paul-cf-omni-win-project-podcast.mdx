# *Efficient Collaboration Through Convergent Facilitation* with Paul Kahawatte

Host: Duncan Autrey - [Omni-Win Project](https://omniwinproject.com)

> Win-wins are possible even in the most challenging situations.

**How can we ensure everyone wins?**  
In this episode with Paul Kahawatte, you’ll get a small taste of the power of convergent facilitation, a process created by OWP podcast guest Miki Kashtan, and learn how to find the non-controversial essence behind what people desire. Using these tools, we can discover what people truly need and find a way to incorporate that into a solution that works for all. 

Paul explains how we can look toward something more transformational and visionary while addressing the practical steps to get there. By integrating different needs, we can create something much more powerful and creative than if we don’t.

After this conversation, Duncan was filled with hope that we can truly create a win-win future. Join us on that journey.
